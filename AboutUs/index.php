            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Founded in 2016, the UIU Robotics Club has grown into a cornerstone of technological innovation at
                United International University. Since its inception, the club has focused on introducing embedded
                systems and robotics to UIU students while building bridges with the corporate world. Over the years, we
                have developed advanced projects, including multicopters and Mars Rovers, and have participated in
                prestigious national and international competitions. Our commitment to excellence has led to the
                establishment of Bangladesh’s first Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Research Lab at UIU, inaugurated on
                December 12 by Zunaid Ahmed Palak, MP, State Minister of ICT
                Division.[](https://robotics.uiu.ac.bd/)[](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/campus-life/clubs-forums/)[](https://cse.uiu.ac.bd/faculty/hafiz-fahim/)
